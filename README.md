# seating-plan-readout

## Work in progress.

## What is this?

A little program to read out a attendee list to get the neighbours of a given person.

## Why would you want this?

Because of Covid-19, certain kinds of events, such as church gatherings, have to keep a seating plan with every person that attends the event.
This program allows you to just keep a list and still have the data displayed visually, if you need to read it.

## How does this work?

	./all

Then follow instructions.

## Building from source

Run this in a terminal:

	git clone https://github.com/TheSingingFox/seating-plan-readout.git
	cd seating-plan-readout/
	g++ -o main main.cpp
